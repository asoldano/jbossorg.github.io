HIGHLIGHTS   OPENID CONNECT / OAUTH 2.0  FAPI 2 DRAFTS SUPPORT  Keycloak has new client profiles fapi-2-security-profile and fapi-2-message-signing, which ensure Keycloak enforces compliance with the latest FAPI 2 draft specifications when communicating with your clients. Thanks to for the contribution.  DPOP PREVIEW SUPPORT  Keycloak has preview for support for OAuth 2.0 Demonstrating Proof-of-Possession at the Application Layer (DPoP). Thanks to and for their contributions.  MORE FLEXIBILITY FOR INTROSPECTION ENDPOINT  In previous versions, introspection endpoint automatically returned most claims, which were available in the access token. Now there is new switch Add to token introspection on most of protocol mappers. This addition allows more flexibility as introspection endpoint can return different claims than access token. This is first step towards \"Lightweight access tokens\" support as access tokens can omit lots of the claims, which would be still returned by the introspection endpoint. When migrating from previous versions, the introspection endpoint should return same claims, which are returned from access token, so the behavior should be effectively the same by default after the migration. Thanks to for the contribution.  FEATURE FLAG FOR OAUTH 2.0 DEVICE AUTHORIZATION GRANT FLOW  The OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant flow now includes a feature flag, so you can easily disable this feature. This feature is still enabled by default. Thanks to for the contribution.   AUTHENTICATION  PASSKEYS SUPPORT  Keycloak has preview support for .  Passkey registration and authentication are realized by the features of WebAuthn. Therefore, users of Keycloak can do passkey registration and authentication by existing WebAuthn registration and authentication.  Both synced passkeys and device-bound passkeys can be used for both Same-Device and Cross-Device Authentication. However, passkeys operations success depends on the user’s environment. Make sure which operations can succeed in . Thanks to for the contribution and thanks to for the help with the ideas and testing of this feature.  WEBAUTHN IMPROVEMENTS  WebAuthn policy now includes a new field: Extra Origins. It provides better interoperability with non-Web platforms (for example, native mobile applications). Thanks to for the contribution.  YOU ARE ALREADY LOGGED-IN  There was an infamous issue that when user had login page opened in multiple browser tabs and authenticated in one of them, the attempt to authenticate in subsequent browser tabs opened the page You are already logged-in. This is improved now as other browser tabs just automatically authenticate as well after authentication of first browser tab. There are still corner cases when the behaviour is not 100% correct, like the scenario with expired authentication session, which is then restarted just in one browser tab and hence other browser tabs won’t follow automatically with the login. So we still plan improvements in this area.  PASSWORD POLICY FOR SPECIFY MAXIMUM AUTHENTICATION TIME  Keycloak supports new password policy, which allows to specify the maximum age of an authentication with which a password may be changed by user without re-authentication. When this password policy is set to 0, the user will be required to re-authenticate to change the password in the Account Console or by other means. You can also specify a lower or higher value than the default value of 5 minutes. Thanks to for the contribution.   DEPLOYMENTS  PREVIEW SUPPORT FOR MULTI-SITE ACTIVE-PASSIVE DEPLOYMENTS  Deploying Keycloak to multiple independent sites is essential for some environments to provide high availability and a speedy recovery from failures. This release adds preview-support for active-passive deployments for Keycloak.  A lot of work has gone into testing and verifying a setup which can sustain load and recover from the failure scenarios. To get started, use the high-availability guide which also includes a comprehensive blueprint to deploy a highly available Keycloak to a cloud environment.   ADAPTERS  OPENID CONNECT WILDFLY AND JBOSS EAP  OpenID Connect adapter for WildFly and JBoss EAP, which was deprecated in previous versions, has been removed in this release. It is being replaced by the Elytron OIDC adapter,which is included in WildFly, and provides a seamless migration from Keycloak adapters.  SAML WILDFLY AND JBOSS EAP  The SAML adapter for WildFly and JBoss EAP is no longer distributed as a ZIP download, but rather a Galleon feature pack, making it easier and more seamless to install.  See the for the details.   SERVER DISTRIBUTION  LOAD SHEDDING SUPPORT  Keycloak now features http-max-queued-requests option to allow proper rejecting of incoming requests under high load. For details refer to the .  RESTEASY REACTIVE  Keycloak has switched to RESTEasy Reactive. Applications using quarkus-resteasy-reactive should still benefit from a better startup time, runtime performance, and memory footprint, even though not using reactive style/semantics. SPI’s that depend directly on JAX-RS API should be compatible with this change. SPI’s that depend on RESTEasy Classic including ResteasyClientBuilder will not be compatible and will require update, this will also be true for other implementation of the JAX-RS API like Jersey.   USER PROFILE  Declarative user profile is still a preview feature in this release, but we are working hard on promoting it to a supported feature. Feedback is welcome. If you find any issues or have any improvements in mind, you are welcome to create , ideally with the label area/user-profile. It is also recommended to check the with the migration changes for this release for some additional informations related to the migration.   GROUP SCALABILITY  Performance around searching of groups is improved for the use-cases with many groups and subgroups. There are improvements, which allow paginated lookup of subgroups. Thanks to for the contribution.   THEMES  LOCALIZATION FILES FOR THEMES DEFAULT TO UTF-8 ENCODING  Message properties files for themes are now read in UTF-8 encoding, with an automatic fallback to ISO-8859-1 encoding.  See the migration guide for more details.   STORAGE  REMOVAL OF THE MAP STORE  The Map Store has been an experimental feature in previous releases. Starting with this release, it is removed and users should continue to use the current JPA store. See the migration guide for details.
