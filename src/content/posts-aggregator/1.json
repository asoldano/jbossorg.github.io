  "content": "We are glad to announce that we are releasing DashBuilder 0.14.1! The major change for this new release is the adoption of Quarkus as the backend for Dashbuilder Runtime and the introduction of Dashbuilder Authoring, a new tool to create dashboards.  The project code has also moved to Kogito tooling, which means that it will be regularly released with other kogito tooling tools.  You may be asking why 0.14.1 and not 8.0. The reason is that Dashbuilder is now part of and will follow its release cycle.   DASHBUILDER IMPROVEMENTS AND NEW FEATURES  The major change for 0.14.1 is that now Dashbuilder Runtime is based on Quarkus. It means quicker startup time (10x faster to start) and better overall performance. As a consequence we now have some changes:   * Dev mode now uses SSE (Server-Sent Event);  * Client to server communication is done via REST;  * HTTP Compression comes from Quarkus;  * New uploaded can be disabled using system property    dashbuilder.runtime.allowUpload; When false new uploads will not be    supported;  * SQL DataSource configuration can be done using system properties:  java -Ddashbuilder.datasources=sample  > -Ddashbuilder.datasource.sample.jdbcUrl=jdbc:mariadb://localhost:3306/sample  > -Ddashbuilder.datasource.sample.providerClassName=org.mariadb.jdbc.Driver  > -Ddashbuilder.datasource.sample.maxSize=10  > -Ddashbuilder.datasource.sample.principal=repasse  > -Ddashbuilder.datasource.sample.credential=repasse  > -jar target/dashbuilder-runtime-8.0.0-Alpha.jar  Make sure to change JDBC URL and Driver according to the used DB. The supported databases are the same as supported by .  The post appeared first on .  "
