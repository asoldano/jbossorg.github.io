  "content": "Today, we released Quarkus 3.8.3, our second (we skipped 3.8.0) maintenance release for the 3.8 release train.  This release contains bugfixes and documentation improvements.  It should be a safe upgrade for anyone already using 3.8.   UPDATE  To update to Quarkus 3.8, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:  quarkus update  Note that quarkus update can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.8.  If you are not already using 3.x, please refer to the for all the details. You can also refer to for additional details. Once you upgraded to 3.0, also have a look at the , , , , , , , migration guides.   GRAALVM SDK UPDATE  In Quarkus 3.8.3, we updated the GraalVM SDK artifacts version to 23.1.2. It was an oversight and should have been done long ago.  If you are developing extensions containing GraalVM substitutions, it is highly recommended to replace the org.graalvm.sdk:graal-sdk dependency with org.graalvm.sdk:nativeimage, that only contains the classes required to develop substitutions.  Also if you are using the Javascript polyglot features of GraalVM, org.graalvm.js:js should be replaced by:   * org.graalvm.polyglot:js-community if you are using the community version of    GraalVM   * org.graalvm.polyglot:js if you are using the enterprise version of GraalVM  While the first change is handled by quarkus update, the second one has to be done manually depending on your GraalVM distribution of choice.
