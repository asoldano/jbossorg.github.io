  "content": "Weâ€™re pleased to announce for Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift.  This is the first Operator release based on Infinispan 13.  Release highlights:   * Custom server configuration. Add custom configuration for Infinispan Server    using ConfigMap objects.   * Configurable number of relay nodes for cross-site replication. Relay nodes    send and receive replication requests from backup locations. You can now    increase the number of relay nodes with the sites.local.maxRelayNodes field    to achieve a better distribution of cross-site replication requests.   * TLS security for cross-site replication traffic. You can now encrypt    cross-site connections between Infinispan clusters with TLS by adding    keystore secrets and configuring the sites.local.encryption field.   * Operator SDK upgraded to v1.3.2"
