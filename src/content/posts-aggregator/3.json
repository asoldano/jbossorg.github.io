  "content": "It is our pleasure to announce the release of Quarkus 3.5.0.  Major changes are:   * Official support for Java 21 (meaning it’s fully tested in our CI)   * GraalVM/Mandrel builder images updated to Java 21   * Several OIDC-related enhancements  This version also comes with bugfixes, performance improvements and documentation improvements.  We currently maintain two version streams in the community:   * 3.5: it is the latest and greatest and it introduces new features   * 3.2: it is our current  Quarkus 2.x is not maintained in the community anymore. If you are using the community version, please upgrade to Quarkus 3.x (either 3.2 LTS or 3.5).   UPDATE  To update to Quarkus 3.5, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:  quarkus update  To migrate from 3.4, please refer to .  If you are not already using 3.x, please refer to the for all the details. You can also refer to for additional details. Once you upgraded to 3.0, also have a look at the , , , and migration guides.   WHAT’S NEW?   JAVA 21  Most of Quarkus was already working with Java 21 but we polished a few things during the 3.5 development cycle and Quarkus is now fully tested with Java 21. The main reason why we were not able to include Java 21 in our CI before is that part of our build is using Gradle (typically to build the Gradle plugin) and Gradle doesn’t fully support Java 21 yet. To overcome this situation, we have decoupled the JVM used to build the Gradle bits from the JVM used to build Quarkus and run our tests, so we won’t have this problem in the future anymore.  Quarkus supports Java 11, Java 17, and Java 21.   GRAALVM/MANDREL  We updated our native executable builder images to GraalVM/Mandrel for Java 21 (this is the new version scheme for GraalVM, they now target a Java version).  We still support GraalVM/Mandrel 23.0 but we recommend using GraalVM/Mandrel for Java 21.   OIDC  TOKENSTATEMANAGER BACKED BY DATABASE  The TokenStateManager can now be backed by the database of your choice.  You can find more information about the new extension introduced to support this feature in .  MASTODON PROVIDER  Our OIDC extension provides preconfigured setups for a lot of well-known identity providers (such as Google, GitHub, Apple… ).  Quarkus 3.5 adds Mastodon to this list.  OIDC SCOPE ATTRIBUTE  The OIDC scope attribute is now mapped to the SecurityIdentity permissions.   HIBERNATE REACTIVE AND AGROAL  Hibernate Reactive can now coexist with Agroal meaning you can use Flyway or Liquibase in your applications using Hibernate Reactive as the ORM.  It is still not possible to have both Hibernate ORM and Hibernate Reactive in the same application.   DECOMPILER CHANGED TO VINEFLOWER  When developing extensions or working on Quarkus internals, it is often practical to decompile the generated classes as the output of the bytecode is more readable than the bytecode.  Quarkus includes the ability to do it automatically and we changed the compiler from Quiltflower to Vineflower, which is the continuation of Quiltflower. You can find more information about this feature in .   FULL CHANGELOG  You can get the full changelog of and on GitHub.   CONTRIBUTORS  The Quarkus community is growing and has now .
