More on that when WildFly 31 comes out in    January!  We will start 2024 with the WildFly 31 release and with a great online mini-conference — a day dedicated to presentations and discussions about WildFly with our community. We will announce the conference date later, but it will likely be in February.  Thanks all for of your for your work and help in making WildFly a successful Open Source project. We are looking forward to continuing working with you next year!  Best wishes from the WildFly team and Happy New Year!   * Brian"
