This wasn’t sufficient for more complex cases, so we created the I18nWrapped component. This enables you to wrap any component of your choice! The best part is that it uses TypeScript to ensure that you’re doing everything correctly.  Let’s see how it works.  Firstly we’ve created a new function called wrapped(componentName: string): Wrapped<componentName>. It tells the name of the components that can be used on the I18nWrapped component props.
