This includes an update to WildFly Preview.  The full list of issues resolved in WildFly 26.1.1 is available . Issues resolved in the WildFly Core update included with WildFly 26.1.1 are available .  Note that the release artifacts are available in public maven in the but at the time of writing we’re aware of some issues with syncing artifacts from there to Maven Central, so there may be some delays before the 26.1.1.Final artifacts can be resolved from there.  Enjoy!"
