It means that users would be able to run our extensions on this platform as¬†well.  Since then, we have been looking forward to seeing this feature enabled in . For those not familiar with gitpod.io, it basically provides a fully online development environment for you to work in your code on top of eclipse-theia.

And you can leverage that to develop your Business Automation assets. Check out how to do¬†that!  Photo by on¬†   1-) ACCESS YOUR¬†CODE  The first step is to go to your repository. Gitpod supports GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket. It gives you the flexibility to host your project wherever you¬†want.  In this post, I‚Äôll be using , which contains a maven project created from the .  GitHub repository example.   2-) START GITPOD.IO  The second step is to add gitpod.io/# as prefix to your repository URL and simply open¬†it.  In my case, I‚Äôm accessing gitpod.io/#.  The first time you access Gitpod, you‚Äôll be asked to log in with GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. After doing so, Gitpod will automatically create a workspace for you and open your repository in the¬†IDE.  Starting up your workspace on gitpod.io.  You can also install the Gitpod which will basically do Step 2 for you with a click of a button. Once you install the extension, the button will be available in your repository.  Gitpod Chrome extension adds a button in your repository.   3-) INSTALL RED HAT BUSINESS AUTOMATION BUNDLE  The third step is to install our extensions as you would normally do on VS Code.

To do so, simply use the provided terminal as you would use in VS¬†Code.  Since my repository has a maven project, I can run mvn clean install, which builds the project and runs the¬†tests.  Project built within Gitpod using the terminal.  I can also start up Quarkus in development mode. To do so, I can run mvn clean package quarkus:dev -DskipTests on the terminal. Then, I can access the SwaggerUI to test my model. Remember, I didn‚Äôt install anything on my machine as all those things are in the cloud! Awesome, am I¬†right?  Starting up Quarkus in development mode and accessing the SwaggerUI.  You can even set the service to be publicly available and share the SwaggerUI URL for others to¬†try!  And that‚Äôs all for today. Thanks for reading!¬†üòÉ  The post appeared first on .  "
