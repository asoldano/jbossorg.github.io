  "content": "We have just launched a fresh new Kogito Tooling release! 🎉 On the 0.12.0 , we made a lot of improvements and bug fixes. We are also happy to announce that this release marks the first iteration of our ‘DMN deploy on OpenShift’ feature, and also we have a lot of improvements on our DMN and BPMN Editors.  This post will give a quick overview of this . I hope you enjoy it!   DEPLOY DECISIONS TO DMN DEVELOPER SANDBOX ON DMN.NEW  We just launched in our dmn.new environment a feature that allows you to quickly deploy decision models to the Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift.  This feature is super cool, and I invite you to give it a try. You can also check more details on this blog .   DMN NODES ARE NOT CREATED ON TOP OF THE SELECTED NODE  DMN diagrams are generally vertical (whereas BPMN is horizontal). When adding a “Decision Node” from a “DMN Input Data,” for better usability, now the nodes are created on top of the selected node.   DMN SUPPORT FOR BEND-POINTS ON CONNECTORS  We also added support for bend-points on the DMN diagram that are pretty useful, especially on Complex DMN diagrams.  See this for more details.   LINE SPLICING FOR BPMN AND DMN EDITORS  Line splicing is a new feature that allows dropping an existing node on top of a connector and automatically split it into two new connectors. This was included in both our DMN and BPMN editors.  Soon we will publish a blog post with a detailed description of this feature.   RESIZE CONTROL POINTS IMPROVEMENTS  We made many improvements on resizing control points for our BPMN and DMN editor, including changing the resize icon and modifying how magnets react on a resize.   SUPPORT FOR PROCESS METADATA ATTRIBUTES  We also added a new AdvancedData that allows users to add generic metadata to all node types and event types in the BPMN editor.
