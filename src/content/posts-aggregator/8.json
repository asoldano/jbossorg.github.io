  "content": "We released Quarkus 3.14.2, a maintenance release for our 3.14 release train.  It contains several important bugfixes so we recommend the upgrade for anyone already using 3.14.  While our maintenance releases usually don’t include important changes, we had to make an exception for the upgrade to Micrometer 1.13.  Our main issue was that Micrometer 1.12 would reach EOL in a few months, which wasn’t in line with the upcoming 3.15 LTS release. As previously explained, 3.15 will be based the continuation of the 3.14 branch, thus why we included this update in 3.14.  The has been updated to reflect that.   UPDATE  To update to Quarkus 3.14, we recommend updating to the latest version of the Quarkus CLI and run:  quarkus update  Note that quarkus update can update your applications from any version of Quarkus (including 2.x) to Quarkus 3.14.
