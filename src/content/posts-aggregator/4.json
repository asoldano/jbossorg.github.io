  "content": "Quick summary: Presentation and demo below ! ðŸ™‚  A few months ago, we did a set of webinars as part of our event, but for those that might have missed it, the recording is now available! In my session, I gave a bit of an introduction to Process Automation and our journey with jBPM.  > Automation has never been more important, but automating business processes > end-to-end comes with many challenges. Â Learn how Red Hat Process Automation > Manager has evolved over the years to support the execution of complex > processes at scale. Â Hear about the building blocks we offer that make the > life of developers easier and enable easy integration with many other > technologies out there. Â We will show you some of the latest improvements, > from event-driven processes to a 100% cloud-native approach to bring your > workloads to the hybrid cloud.Â   Thereâ€™s also a live demo included (starting at 30:34). Itâ€™s showing an event-driven cloud-native straight-through process, with some focus on developer productivity in VSCode and scalability (buzzword bingo!). Enjoy!   Feel free to also take a look at the sessions from Matteo on Decision Automation with DMN and from Geoffrey on vaccination scheduling with Optaplanner .    The post appeared first on .  "
