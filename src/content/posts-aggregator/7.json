  "content": "The Kogito Tooling release 0.16.0 includes three container images to make it easy to deploy the KIE Sandbox to an OpenShift instance. All these container images are publicly available onÂ .  Letâ€™s describe the container images and check out how to deploy them in thisÂ post.  Photo by onÂ    KIE SANDBOX EXTENDEDÂ SERVICES  Formerly known as KIE Tooling Extended Services, the KIE Sandbox Extended Services extends the capabilities of the editors through external services, such as the DMNÂ Runner.  Since the release of the extended services, users install the services on their machines and point the KIE Sandbox to a local port to interact with the provided features.  Starting from Kogito Tooling release 0.16.0, a container image that includes the extended services is provided, which users can deploy and point the KIE Sandbox to the corresponding container public URL. In other words, there is no need to install it locallyÂ anymore.  This is not mandatory, though. If users do not want to deploy their own KIE Sandbox Extended Services container, they can keep using the extended services locally, the same asÂ before.  Now, letâ€™s see how to deploy the KIE Sandbox Extended Services to OpenShift using the web interface. You will need the following container image:  quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/kie-sandbox-extended-services-image:0.16.0  Deploying the KIE Sandbox Extended Services image to OpenShift  Note: The route must be over HTTPS.   CORS PROXY  The 0.14.1 release of Kogito Tooling marks the evolution of theÂ .NEW environment to KIE Sandbox. Among many features, users can clone GitHub repositories right inside the sandbox and push changes back toÂ GitHub.  Watch the KIELive#53 if you havenâ€™t done it yet to learn more about the new generation of online authoring tools.    However, to interact with GitHub through the KIE Sandbox, a CORS Proxy is needed to be placed in between them. Otherwise, requests from the KIE Sandbox would not be accepted due to GitHubâ€™s policy. Thus, a CORS Proxy deployment is internally configured.  As part of the Kogito Tooling release 0.16.0, a container image has also been prepared for users to have their own CORS Proxy deployment rather than using the Â one.  This is not mandatory as well. If users do not want to deploy their own CORS Proxy container, they can continue to use the one with no changes required.  Being very similar to deploying the KIE Sandbox Extended Services, letâ€™s check out how to deploy the CORS Proxy to OpenShift using the web interface. You will need the following container image:  quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/cors-proxy-image:0.16.0  Deploying the CORS Proxy image to OpenShift  Note: The route must be over HTTPS.   KIE SANDBOX  Last but not least, a container image for theÂ KIE SandboxÂ is also included in theÂ 0.16.0Â release, enabling users to have their ownÂ KIE SandboxÂ deployment.  Moreover, theÂ KIE SandboxÂ accepts environment variables that can be configured during the deployment to connect it with theÂ KIE Sandbox Extended ServicesÂ andÂ CORS ProxyÂ deployments. The environment variables are:   * KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL: The URL that points to theÂ KIE Sandbox    Extended ServicesÂ deployment.  * CORS_PROXY_URL: The URL that points to theÂ CORS ProxyÂ deployment  Now, suppose theÂ KIE Sandbox Extended ServicesÂ and theÂ CORS ProxyÂ are already deployed. Letâ€™s check out how to deploy theÂ KIE SandboxÂ using the environment variables to connect them all. You will need the following image:  quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/kie-sandbox-image:0.16.0  Deploying the KIE Sandbox Extended Services image to OpenShift  Notes: The route must be over HTTPS. Also, do not add trailing slashes in the URLs when setting them as environment variable values.  After these steps, a fully configuredÂ KIE SandboxÂ will be deployed and available to try on:  Checking the KIE Sandbox deployment   REVIEW  We have seen the container images that are included in the Kogito ToolingÂ 0.16.0Â release and how to deploy them to OpenShift. Here is a summary of everything that was shown in this post:  Summary of the container images and their corresponding deployments   BONUS: RUNNING THE CONTAINER IMAGES LOCALLY  First, run theÂ CORS ProxyÂ container:  podman run -p 8081:8080 -i quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/cors-proxy-image:0.16.0  It will be available atÂ .  Second, run theÂ KIE Sandbox Extended ServicesÂ container:  podman run -p 21345:21345 -i quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/kie-sandbox-extended-services-image:0.16.0  It will be available atÂ .  Finally, run theÂ KIE SandboxÂ container:  podman run -p 8080:8080 -e KIE_SANDBOX_EXTENDED_SERVICES_URL= -e CORS_PROXY_URL= -i quay.io/kogito_tooling_bot/kie-sandbox-image:0.16.0  It will be available atÂ .  And thatâ€™s all for today. Thanks for reading! ðŸ˜ƒ  The post appeared first on .  "
