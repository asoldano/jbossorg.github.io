In particular the s2i image content is impacted by the removal of legacy security:   * Changes in the default server configuration:         * Now secured with elytron.         * Security configuration based on legacy security-realms has been removed.         * security subsystem and extension have been removed.   * Impact on SSL configuration based on environment variables:         * elytron is now used by default to configure SSL.

ANTICIPATING A FUTURE SUPPORT FOR OPENID CONNECT  In this new release we are deprecating the usage of the keycloak Galleon layer and automatic configuration based on  We are planning in a future release to rely on the that is providing a native support for OpenID Connect allowing to interact with Keycloak server but with also other servers compatible with the OIDC protocol.  Stay tuned!"
